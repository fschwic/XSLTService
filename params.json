Configuration is read from catlina home conf directory. Default config file name is xsltservice.properties. See xsltservice.example.properties.\r\n\r\n### Delayed Requests\r\nEvery request send to XSLTervice where the domain of XML or XSLT document is not known by the service is considered as undesirable and is delayed. To avoid the delay configure the hostnames you want to load XML or XSLT documents from.\r\n\r\n### Logging\r\nXSLTService uses SLF4J for logging. If the used runtime container does not provide SLF4J the slf4j-api.jar and a logger binder should be put in the runtime containers classpath.\r\n","tagline":"Send the URLs of an XML and an XSLT file to this service in order to get the XML transformed by the XSLT as response.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
